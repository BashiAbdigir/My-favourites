    <h2 id="orange">Longboarding</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>I like longboarding in my free time as its a relaxing expereince. I wish I could go downhill with it at some point so I can feel the thrill.  </p>

  <p>There are multiple things I like about this sport which can include:
      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>Non-competive</li>
        <li>Easy to lear</li>
        <li>Least Tiring</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="red">Wreck It Ralph</h2>
    <hr />
       <p>My favourite movie is Wreck It Ralph. I liked it ever since I first watched it due to it having multiple different characters and a unique plot. Althought there are movies I like more than this, it just feels right to keep it as my favourite.
